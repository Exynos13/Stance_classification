Performing based on the stance of the input on a particular target
The model used for this classification was a glove-twitter-100 which is Pre-trained glove vectors based on 2B tweets, 27B tokens, 1.2M vocab, uncased.  
This model was then tuned based on our inputs to create a valid stance prediction.
Model evaluation was done with help of the performance metrics of Loss, Accuracy, AUC curve, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
